annotations.zip was generated from tools/adt/idea CL
234839667c6912ff7eaccd9102525d0ba495c886

(by building the Android Studio tree by running ./build_studio.sh
in tools/idea, then copying the resulting androidAnnotations.jar
as this annotations.zip file.)

----

api-versions.xml was copied from platform-tools version 25.0.3.
This file is typically generated as part of the SDK build process,
but the AOSP build doesn't have the correct bits so this is a
prebuilt from the last release.
